# Machine-Learning-Algorithms-from-scratch
This is a repository that contains Python implementations of various machine learning algorithms from scratch.
Each algorithm is implemented using only basic Python libraries (e.g. NumPy) without relying on external machine learning frameworks (e.g. scikit-learn). 
The code is well-structured, modular, and easy to understand, making it a great resource for those who want to learn how machine learning algorithms work under the hood.
Whether you're a beginner or an experienced machine learning practitioner, this project is a great way to gain a deeper understanding of machine learning algorithms and their implementation.
